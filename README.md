# IShare

IShare is DApp which let's holder to request his/her credentials from the issuer. 
The issuer then issues the credentials and holder accepts it. 
These credentials can be later verified by diffrent verifier for different purposes.
It is still in working projects \
**This project tries to use Zero knowledge proof.** \
Later I will be deploying this project on Vercel creating a CI/CD pipeline \
Anyone is free to contribute, suggest new ideas, fix issues in this project.
